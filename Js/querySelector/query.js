/*

getElementsbyclass: return array of html collection
    if class = "class-1 class 2"
    you can select class-2 directly , you have fisrt select class-1 then you can class-2

    if you can also select a particular item using id but you have define id for each and every element this 
    create a problem in tracking 

    therefore we use querySeletor for that
